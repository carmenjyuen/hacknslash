This is a Unity "Hack and Slash" Tutorial I am trying out. 

The tutorial is done by BurgZergArcade on Youtube, and the link to the series is here: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE5C2870574BF4B06

Tutorial was also done in C Sharp, not Javascript (which is what GitHub seems to think it is).
